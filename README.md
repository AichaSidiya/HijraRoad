## Description

The project is a figma UX/UI design with 4 interfaces.
* To Madinah, an interactive map that contains the most important stations of the Prophet’s migration that will appear to the user if he visits the city and he can get to know them more and listen to the story of the migration.
* Immigration is divided into short stories about the most important situations and presented in a cartoon format for children with a flash card game, to ensure the child learned something from the stories he listened to. 
* Introducing the child to the most important rituals of Hajj and Umrah, the most important dhikrs and supplications during Hajj and Umrah, and the importance of these rituals, as he can identify them if he goes with his family to Hajj and Umrah
* Familiarize the child with the most important daily remembrances, such as the morning and evening remembrances, pre-sleep and post-prayer remembrances (audio)
